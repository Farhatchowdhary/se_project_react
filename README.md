# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

 # WTWR (What to Wear?) - Backend

## Project Description

WTWR (What to Wear?) is a full-stack web application that helps users decide what to wear based on current weather conditions. The application provides personalized clothing recommendations by analyzing real-time weather data and allowing users to manage their personal wardrobe.

### Key Features:
- **Weather Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data to provide temperature-based clothing recommendations
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system with JWT tokens
- **Personal Wardrobe**: Users can add, edit, and delete their own clothing items
- **Interactive Features**: Like/unlike clothing items with persistent state
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

### Technical Implementation:
- **Frontend**: React.js with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js RESTful API
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- **Deployment**: Cloud-deployed with SSL encryption and domain configuration
- **Process Management**: PM2 for server reliability and crash recovery

## Deployed Application
- **Domain:** https://seprojectexpress.tk
